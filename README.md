# MLcode-for-HEAphase

This project applies machine learning methods (artificial neural network, 1d convolutional neural network and support vector machine with Gaussian kernel) to solve the phase selection problem in high entropy alloys.
This project includes the calculation of features with given elements and fractions (matlab), artificial neural network (ANN, matlab), 1dconvolutional neural network (CNN, python), and support vector machine (SVM, matlab). 

All the three models give the traning and prediction parts, while artificial neural network is attached with the extraction of senstivitiy matrix.
